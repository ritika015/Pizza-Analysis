# Pizza-Analysis
## Project Title: SQL Pizza Sales Analysis 
### Level: Intermediate
### Database: pizza

## Project Overview
<br>
This project analyzes pizza sales data using SQL queries to uncover key insights into sales trends, revenue, customer preferences, and order patterns. By leveraging SQL techniques like joins, aggregations, window functions, and ranking, we derive valuable business insights that can help optimize sales strategies and operations.

## Dataset Overview 
The dataset consists of four CSV files, each representing a different aspect of the pizza sales business.
- orders Table: Contains order ID, date, and time of purchase.
- order_details Table: Links each order to pizzas, with quantity ordered.
- pizzas Table: Contains pizza ID, type, size, and price.
- pizza_types Table: Lists different pizza names and their categories.

``` sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(order_id)
FROM
    orders;
```


2) List all unique pizza types available.

``` sql
SELECT DISTINCT
    (name)
FROM
    pizza_types;

```

3) Get the total number of pizzas sold.

    pizza_types.category,
    SUM(order_details.quantity) AS quantity
FROM
    pizza_types
        JOIN
    pizzas ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
        JOIN
    order_details ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_types.category
ORDER BY quantity DESC; 

```

5) Identify all orders where more than 2 pizzas were ordered.

## Final Conclusion for SQL Pizza Sales Analysis
<br>
The SQL Pizza Sales Analysis provides valuable insights into customer preferences, sales trends, and business performance. The data reveals that Pepperoni pizza is the most popular choice, while Large-sized pizzas generate the highest sales. Sales peak between 7 PM - 9 PM, with Saturdays being the busiest day, indicating high demand during weekends. Revenue is significantly higher on weekends compared to weekdays, suggesting a strong preference for dining out or ordering in during leisure time. However, certain pizza types, like Cheese Lovers, have low sales, highlighting an opportunity for targeted promotions. To optimize business performance, inventory should be managed efficiently, staffing should be increased during peak hours, and new marketing strategies should be introduced for underperforming pizzas. These insights enable data-driven decision-making, helping improve customer satisfaction and maximize profitability. üöÄüçï
